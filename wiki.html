      <h2>Data Privacy and Cybersecurity: A Perpetualite's Perspective</h2>
      <p>Data privacy is about protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.<br> As a student, you leave a digital footprint with every online activity, from browsing the web to using social media. Companies collect your data for various purposes, including targeted advertising and personalized experiences. <br>Understanding how your data is used is essential to protect yourself from identity theft, privacy violations, and reputation risks. Take steps to safeguard your privacy by using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, being careful about what you share online, and reviewing privacy settings on all platforms.</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity involves protecting your devices, data, and online accounts from cyber threats. <br>Staying safe online means being aware of common risks like malware, phishing scams, and social engineering. <br>Protect your devices by installing antivirus software, using a firewall, and keeping your operating system and applications updated. Be cautious about downloading files, connecting to public Wi-Fi without a VPN, and sharing personal information online. <br>By practicing safe online habits and staying informed about cybersecurity threats, you can minimize your risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime.</p>
